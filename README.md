# Multi-Hazard-Risk-Analysis-Using-Hypergraphs
This repository contains the code and resources accompanying the paper "Impacts from cascading multi-hazards using hypergraphs: a case study from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal". The project introduces a hypergraph-based framework for multi-hazard risk analysis, enabling efficient simulation of cascading hazard impacts on infrastructure.
